      </h1>
      <p>
        This section explains some of the rationale and technical details
        behind the overall build method. It is not essential to immediately
        understand everything in this section. Most of this information will
        be clearer after performing an actual build. This section can be
        referred to at any time during the process.
      </p>
      <p>
        The overall goal of <a class="xref" href=
        "../chapter05/chapter05.html" title=
        "Chapter&nbsp;5.&nbsp;Compiling a Cross-Toolchain">Chapter&nbsp;5</a>
        and <a class="xref" href="../chapter06/chapter06.html" title=
        "Chapter&nbsp;6.&nbsp;Cross Compiling Temporary Tools">Chapter&nbsp;6</a>
        is to produce a temporary area that contains a known-good set of
        tools that can be isolated from the host system. By using
        <span class="command"><strong>chroot</strong></span>, the commands in
        the remaining chapters will be contained within that environment,
        ensuring a clean, trouble-free build of the target LFS system. The
        build process has been designed to minimize the risks for new readers
        and to provide the most educational value at the same time.
      </p>
      <p>
        The build process is based on the process of <span class=
        "emphasis"><em>cross-compilation</em></span>. Cross-compilation is
        normally used for building a compiler and its toolchain for a machine
        different from the one that is used for the build. This is not
        strictly needed for LFS, since the machine where the new system will
        run is the same as the one used for the build. But cross-compilation
        has the great advantage that anything that is cross-compiled cannot
        depend on the host environment.

        <p>
          Cross-compilation involves some concepts that deserve a section on
          their own. Although this section may be omitted in a first reading,
          it is strongly suggested to come back to it later in order to get a
          full grasp of the build process.

          Let us first define some terms used in this context:

            <dd>
              <p>
                is the machine where we build programs. Note that this
                machine is referred to as the <span class=
                "quote">&ldquo;<span class="quote">host</span>&rdquo;</span>
                in other sections.
              </p>
            </dd>
            <dt>
              <span class="term">host</span>
            </dt>
            <dd>
              <p>
                is the machine/system where the built programs will run. Note
                that this use of <span class="quote">&ldquo;<span class=
                "quote">host</span>&rdquo;</span> is not the same as in other
                sections.
              </p>
            </dd>
            <dt>

              <p>
                is only used for compilers. It is the machine the compiler
                produces code for. It may be different from both build and
                host.

          As an example, let us imagine the following scenario (sometimes
          referred to as <span class="quote">&ldquo;<span class=
          "quote">Canadian Cross</span>&rdquo;</span>): we may have a
          compiler on a slow machine only, let's call the machine A, and the
          compiler ccA. We may have also a fast machine (B), but with no
          compiler, and we may want to produce code for another slow machine
          (C). To build a compiler for machine C, we would have three stages:

          Then, all the other programs needed by machine C can be compiled
          using cc2 on the fast machine B. Note that unless B can run
          programs produced for C, there is no way to test the built programs
          until machine C itself is running. For example, for testing ccC, we
          may want to add a fourth stage:

          <p>
            Almost all the build systems use names of the form
            cpu-vendor-kernel-os referred to as the machine triplet. An
            astute reader may wonder why a <span class=
            "quote">&ldquo;<span class="quote">triplet</span>&rdquo;</span>
            refers to a four component name. The reason is history:
            initially, three component names were enough to designate
            unambiguously a machine, but with new machines and systems
            appearing, that proved insufficient. The word <span class=
            "quote">&ldquo;<span class="quote">triplet</span>&rdquo;</span>
            remained. A simple way to determine your machine triplet is to
            run the <span class=
            "command"><strong>config.guess</strong></span> script that comes
            with the source for many packages. Unpack the binutils sources
            and run the script: <strong class=
            "userinput"><code>./config.guess</code></strong> and note the
            output. For example, for a 32-bit Intel processor the output will
            be <span class="emphasis"><em>i686-pc-linux-gnu</em></span>. On a
            64-bit system it will be <span class=
            "emphasis"><em>x86_64-pc-linux-gnu</em></span>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also be aware of the name of the platform's dynamic linker, often
            referred to as the dynamic loader (not to be confused with the
            standard linker <span class="command"><strong>ld</strong></span>
            that is part of binutils). The dynamic linker provided by Glibc
            finds and loads the shared libraries needed by a program,
            prepares the program to run, and then runs it. The name of the
            dynamic linker for a 32-bit Intel machine will be <code class=
            "filename">ld-linux.so.2</code> (<code class=
            "filename">ld-linux-x86-64.so.2</code> for 64-bit systems). A
            sure-fire way to determine the name of the dynamic linker is to
            inspect a random binary from the host system by running:
            <strong class="userinput"><code>readelf -l &lt;name of binary&gt;
            | grep interpreter</code></strong> and noting the output. The
            authoritative reference covering all platforms is in the
            <code class="filename">shlib-versions</code> file in the root of
            the Glibc source tree.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          In order to fake a cross compilation, the name of the host triplet
          is slightly adjusted by changing the "vendor" field in the
          <code class="envar">LFS_TGT</code> variable. We also use the
          <em class="parameter"><code>--with-sysroot</code></em> option when
          building the cross linker and cross compiler to tell them where to
          find the needed host files. This ensures that none of the other
          programs built in <a class="xref" href=
          "../chapter06/chapter06.html" title=
          "Chapter&nbsp;6.&nbsp;Cross Compiling Temporary Tools">Chapter&nbsp;6</a>
          can link to libraries on the build machine. Only two stages are
          mandatory, and one more for tests:

          Now, there is more about cross-compiling: the C language is not
          just a compiler, but also defines a standard library. In this book,
          the GNU C library, named glibc, is used. This library must be
          compiled for the lfs machine, that is, using the cross compiler
          cc1. But the compiler itself uses an internal library implementing
          complex instructions not available in the assembler instruction
          set. This internal library is named libgcc, and must be linked to
          the glibc library to be fully functional! Furthermore, the standard
          library for C++ (libstdc++) also needs being linked to glibc. The
          solution to this chicken and egg problem is to first build a
          degraded cc1 based libgcc, lacking some functionalities such as
          threads and exception handling, then build glibc using this
          degraded compiler (glibc itself is not degraded), then build
          libstdc++. But this last library will lack the same functionalities
          as libgcc.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is not the end of the story: the conclusion of the preceding
          paragraph is that cc1 is unable to build a fully functional
          libstdc++, but this is the only compiler available for building the
          C/C++ libraries during stage 2! Of course, the compiler built
          during stage 2, cc-lfs, would be able to build those libraries, but
          (1) the build system of GCC does not know that it is usable on pc,
          and (2) using it on pc would be at risk of linking to the pc
          libraries, since cc-lfs is a native compiler. So we have to build
          libstdc++ later, in chroot.

        <p>
          The cross-compiler will be installed in a separate <code class=
          "filename">$LFS/tools</code> directory, since it will not be part
          of the final system.
        </p>
        <p>
          Binutils is installed first because the <span class=
          "command"><strong>configure</strong></span> runs of both GCC and
          Glibc perform various feature tests on the assembler and linker to
          determine which software features to enable or disable. This is
          more important than one might first realize. An incorrectly
          configured GCC or Glibc can result in a subtly broken toolchain,
          where the impact of such breakage might not show up until near the
          end of the build of an entire distribution. A test suite failure
          will usually highlight this error before too much additional work
          is performed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Binutils installs its assembler and linker in two locations,
          <code class="filename">$LFS/tools/bin</code> and <code class=
          "filename">$LFS/tools/$LFS_TGT/bin</code>. The tools in one
          location are hard linked to the other. An important facet of the
          linker is its library search order. Detailed information can be
          obtained from <span class="command"><strong>ld</strong></span> by
          passing it the <em class="parameter"><code>--verbose</code></em>
          flag. For example, <span class="command"><strong>$LFS_TGT-ld
          --verbose | grep SEARCH</strong></span> will illustrate the current
          search paths and their order. It shows which files are linked by
          <span class="command"><strong>ld</strong></span> by compiling a
          dummy program and passing the <em class=
          "parameter"><code>--verbose</code></em> switch to the linker. For
          example, <span class="command"><strong>$LFS_TGT-gcc dummy.c
          -Wl,--verbose 2&gt;&amp;1 | grep succeeded</strong></span> will
          show all the files successfully opened during the linking.
        </p>
        <p>
          The next package installed is GCC. An example of what can be seen
          during its run of <span class=
          "command"><strong>configure</strong></span> is:
        </p>
        <pre class="screen">
<code class=
"computeroutput">checking what assembler to use... /mnt/lfs/tools/i686-lfs-linux-gnu/bin/as
checking what linker to use... /mnt/lfs/tools/i686-lfs-linux-gnu/bin/ld</code>
</pre>
        <p>
          This is important for the reasons mentioned above. It also
          demonstrates that GCC's configure script does not search the PATH
          directories to find which tools to use. However, during the actual
          operation of <span class="command"><strong>gcc</strong></span>
          itself, the same search paths are not necessarily used. To find out
          which standard linker <span class=
          "command"><strong>gcc</strong></span> will use, run: <span class=
          "command"><strong>$LFS_TGT-gcc -print-prog-name=ld</strong></span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Detailed information can be obtained from <span class=
          "command"><strong>gcc</strong></span> by passing it the <em class=
          "parameter"><code>-v</code></em> command line option while
          compiling a dummy program. For example, <span class=
          "command"><strong>gcc -v dummy.c</strong></span> will show detailed
          information about the preprocessor, compilation, and assembly
          stages, including <span class=
          "command"><strong>gcc</strong></span>'s included search paths and
          their order.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next installed are sanitized Linux API headers. These allow the
          standard C library (Glibc) to interface with features that the
          Linux kernel will provide.
        </p>
        <p>
          The next package installed is Glibc. The most important
          considerations for building Glibc are the compiler, binary tools,
          and kernel headers. The compiler is generally not an issue since
          Glibc will always use the compiler relating to the <em class=
          "parameter"><code>--host</code></em> parameter passed to its
          configure script; e.g. in our case, the compiler will be
          <span class="command"><strong>$LFS_TGT-gcc</strong></span>. The
          binary tools and kernel headers can be a bit more complicated.
          Therefore, take no risks and use the available configure switches
          to enforce the correct selections. After the run of <span class=
          "command"><strong>configure</strong></span>, check the contents of
          the <code class="filename">config.make</code> file in the
          <code class="filename">build</code> directory for all important
          details. Note the use of <em class=
          "parameter"><code>CC="$LFS_TGT-gcc"</code></em> (with <code class=
          "envar">$LFS_TGT</code> expanded) to control which binary tools are
          used and the use of the <em class=
          "parameter"><code>-nostdinc</code></em> and <em class=
          "parameter"><code>-isystem</code></em> flags to control the
          compiler's include search path. These items highlight an important
          aspect of the Glibc package&mdash;it is very self-sufficient in
          terms of its build machinery and generally does not rely on
          toolchain defaults.
        </p>
        <p>
          As said above, the standard C++ library is compiled next, followed
          in <a class="xref" href="../chapter06/chapter06.html" title=
          "Chapter&nbsp;6.&nbsp;Cross Compiling Temporary Tools">Chapter&nbsp;6</a>
          by all the programs that need themselves to be built. The install
          step of all those packages uses the <code class=
          "envar">DESTDIR</code> variable to have the programs land into the
          LFS filesystem.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the end of <a class="xref" href="../chapter06/chapter06.html"
          title=
          "Chapter&nbsp;6.&nbsp;Cross Compiling Temporary Tools">Chapter&nbsp;6</a>
          the native lfs compiler is installed. First binutils-pass2 is
          built, with the same <code class="envar">DESTDIR</code> install as
          the other programs, then the second pass of GCC is constructed,
          omitting libstdc++ and other non-important libraries. Due to some
          weird logic in GCC's configure script, <code class=
          "envar">CC_FOR_TARGET</code> ends up as <span class=
          "command"><strong>cc</strong></span> when the host is the same as
          the target, but is different from the build system. This is why
          <em class="parameter"><code>CC_FOR_TARGET=$LFS_TGT-gcc</code></em>
          is put explicitly into the configure options.
        </p>
        <p>
          Upon entering the chroot environment in <a class="xref" href=
          "../chapter07/chapter07.html" title=
          "Chapter&nbsp;7.&nbsp;Entering Chroot and Building Additional Temporary Tools">
          Chapter&nbsp;7</a>, the first task is to install libstdc++. Then
          temporary installations of programs needed for the proper operation
          of the toolchain are performed. Programs needed for testing other
          programs are also built. From this point onwards, the core
          toolchain is self-contained and self-hosted. In <a class="xref"
          href="../chapter08/chapter08.html" title=
          "Chapter&nbsp;8.&nbsp;Installing Basic System Software">Chapter&nbsp;8</a>,
          final versions of all the packages needed for a fully functional
          system are built, tested and installed.
